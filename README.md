# To run the project: python3 db_demo.py
# Sources used:
# 1.https://pythonprogramming.net/sqlite-part-3-reading-database-python/
# --> used as a reference for printing table in python, I was having difficulty using pandas Datafram to print the table so I decided to print the table by each row
# 2. https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
# --> used as a reference for casting GPA as a numeric and setting isDeleted to integer values of 0 and 1 in the SQLite database
#
# Student.py is not used in the db_demo.py file because I found it easier to enter data into tables without using a Student class
